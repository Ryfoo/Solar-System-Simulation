# Solar-System-Simulation
 Visualization of how our solar system operate using physics laws

a simple and cool animation shows how our planets move around the sun in an organized system with physics laws, and real values (velocities, mass values, ...)

using only : pygame==2.6.1

#for any modifications :
    you need only to edit the "TIMESTEP" value in order to speed up or slow down the process
    or "SCALE" variable to zoom in or zoom out.
